    "A measurement is a number or attribute computed for each member of a population or of a sample. The measurement of sample elements are collectively called the sample data.\n",

    "is the branch of statistics that involves drawing conclusions about a population based on i formation contained in a sample taken form that population.\n",

    "are measurements for which their is no natural numerical scale, but which consist of attributes, labels. or other non-numerical characteristics.\n",
